### Project Overview
This research evaluates how different audiences (public vs. experts) interpret the UK Flood Guidance Statement (FGS) risk matrix. The goal is to provide evidence-based design recommendations to the **UK Met Office** and **Flood Forecasting Centre**.

### Key Tasks & Methodology
**Experimental Design:** Designed and tested 5 alternative risk matrix formats involving variations in color, size, and labeling.

**Data Collection:** Conducted a mixed-method study with 351 public participants and 12 hydrometeorological experts.

**Statistical Analysis:** Applied **ANOVA** and **linear mixed-effects models** in **R** to assess clarity, trust, and behavioral intentions.

### Results
Proposed data-driven recommendations for improving the National Severe Weather Warning Service (NSWWS) to enhance public protective decision-making.
